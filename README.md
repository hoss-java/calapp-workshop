# CalApp
[**Deck Board**](https://github.com/hoss-java/calapp-workshop/blob/main/DECK.md)

## The idea
* The main idea is to learn more about Java and its related tools and java-frameworks. To achive this goal :
> 1. CalAppV1 (a singel java file) - Coding a simple java code to get numbers and oprtors as input (all sepertly) and then print results.
> 2. CalAppV2 (a singel java file) - Coding a new CalApp to get a sting as input and parssing the string to calculate results.
> 3. Try to implement CalAppV2 in a Maven project.
> 4. Add some tests to the maven created project.
> 5. Try to implement CalAppV2 as a spring project.
> 6. Try to update CalAppV2 to work as service and implement it as a Tomcat object.
* It also can be good to develop or prepare tools that make it easre/faster to code.
* Lookling to see how it can be automated to test and running codes.
